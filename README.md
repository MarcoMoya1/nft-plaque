# nft-plaque
Creating a Plaque for NFT owners. 

With this application you'll be able to add your NFT image, some information on the project and collection, properties for this specific NFT, its number or rank and a QR code for this NFT if you've already created one or know how to make one. 

With this you'll be able to save the content as a JPeg or image and print it out to have a physical plaque for your NFT to display.
